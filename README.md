## Why make this website?

Riddle me this..... you make ₹25,000/month and feel poor. Your neighbor menwhile makes ₹20,000/month and feels rich.... Why?

Because **"Darja" is a mental construct**.

We don't compare ourselves to the billion people earning less than us. We compare ourselves to the few earning more. We only obsess the gap above, never the gap below.

The website doesn't tell you how un-successful you are. It doesn't need to. **You're probably already winning. But you'll never believe it.**

## The Real Message

**You're comparing yourself to:**
- Your college batchmate who works in tech (top 2%)
- Your relative in the US (top 0.5% globally)
- Social Media influencers (survivorship bias)

**You're NOT comparing yourself to:**
- 34% of India earning less than ₹100/day
- 14.9% of youth with unemployment
- The millions of people in the workforce you're ahead of

This is selective bias. <strong>This is why success feels empty.</strong>

## Quote of the Day
<i>Instead of running after the shadows of Unattainable Ideals, perhaps pause to savor the beauty of each step you take in the Present.</i>
